# Basic intro.

### Final Goal
    The game's final goal is to defeat the enemies by runestone drifting
- If the following happens, the game is over and will reset the game : 
    1. If your HP is below zero, you **Lose**.
    2. If you surrender, you **Lose**.
    4. If you pass all of the three levels, you **Win**.

### Mission 1 (Basic requirement)
#### Choosing characters
    You can choose 6 characters at most, and the captain and the vice-captain must be selected.
- You can choose the character by pressing left button on the mouse on the empty character slots.
- For faster selection, you can press the right button on the mouse, five characters would be passed for each click.  

#### Runestone drifting
    Runestone drifting would be the main source of your attack power
- Select and click any runestone that you want to start from.
- Holding the pressing button and start drifting.
- While moving the selected runestone, it will switch the place with any runestone it encounters in the path.
- The goal is to make as many combos as possible (three of more identical runestones in a row or column)

#### Counting combos
    Attack power will only be counted if you make combos successfully
    

### Attack and attributes
    There are five attributes in this game, which will affect the final damage
    When the character counteract the enemy, double the original damage, when the character is counteracted by the enemy, half the original damage.
1. **Earth** : Counteract water, counteracted by fire.
2. **Fire** : Counteract earth, counteracted by water.
3. **Water** : Counteract fire, counteracted by earth.
4. **Dark** : Counteract dark.
5. **Ligth** : Counteract light.
- After randomly choose an enemy, calculating the final damage based on the attribute of the character and the chosen enemy.
  

### Enemy attack
    When the CD of each enemy turns 0, enemy will attack.
- Each enemy has its own attack power, it will attack you directly and has nothing to do with the characters you have choosen

### Next level
    After defeating every enemies in the current level, you will enter the next level (there's three levels in total)
